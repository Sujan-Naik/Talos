# Talos [Pre-Alpha]
Talos is an Agentic Codebase peer-reviewer with general purpose AI assistant functionalities. 

Currently conversational capacities are separate from code-review, 
but in the future the primary interaction mechanism will be voice.

Screen-reading will also be integrated into agentic functionalities, at the moment there is only manual usage. 

## Our Code Base Reviewer

Design pillars contradict most popular Generative AI tools:
> - Improves how you code over coding for you
> - Token-friendly dynamic file request system, review a single file with no assumptions -
    the agent can intelligently locate the dependency
> - Models can be local for cost-efficiency and privacy, provide an open-AI compatible LLM endpoint
